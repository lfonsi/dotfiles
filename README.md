# dotfiles
My dotfiles repository

This is still under development and is very limited. 

I intend to expand it over time with more stuff I regularly use.

To run, cd to the repo folder, choose the desired OS on where the dotfiles will be installed (OSX only for now) and 

```bash
source install.sh
```
